# About
Time Commander is a tower defense game where the player must use their knowledge of analog clocks and time formats to defend their time crystal against hordes of enemies by positioning their defenses at given clock positions. Through three action packed levels, players will experience an increasing size of enemy hordes and must use the items collected from vanquished enemies, along with their defenses to survive in each level. Players will face four types of enemies that will attempt to destroy the crystal. They will have four unique turrets and five possible consumable items to help them along the way.

# How To Play
* The player should read the times displayed up top and place their defenses and consumable items at those times on the clock.

* To access consumable items, the player can hold down the spacebar to open up a wheel which they can drag the items from if they have any. 

* Some enemies will drop chests, the player can click the chests to obtain them, and head to the "open chests" screen.
    - This scene will show the players a chest if they have any available. The player must drag the minute and hour dots to the analog clock
      to match the time given by the prompt at the top and hit submit. If the player is correct, an image of the item they earned is displayed and will be available for use in thecoming waves of enemies.
    - If the player has multiple chests, they can hit the next chest button to keep opening them for more items. 

* After a number of waves, the level is complete and the player simply clicks "next level" on the screen that pops up, after listening to the 
CRAZY music of course. 

* After completing the third level, the game is over and a pleasent song and confetti animation plays.

- If the player dies, or wants to play again after victory, they can just hit the play again button that pops up after the aformentioned      victory or defeat.
